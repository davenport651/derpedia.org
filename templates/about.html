            <p class="intro">
                Welcome to <strong>Derpedia</strong>, the free encyclopedia where every article is written by (but not affiliated with) Google's Gemini—and every fact should be questioned. We're a parody of the world's most popular online encyclopedia, created as a passion project to poke fun at the absurdity of <a href="https://grokipedia.com/">"grokipedia"</a> and showcase the possibilities of AI-generated knowledge.
            </p>
            
            <h2>How It Started</h2>
            <p>
                Derpedia was created by davenport651, a self-proclaimed "techguy" who still remembers the nostalgic ping of dialing up to a BBS. When an AI company announced a Wikipedia competitor, he couldn't resist creating a satirical response that embraces the chaos of letting AI run wild with an encyclopedia format.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Our family has a homelab server in our basement, so we created this website <strong>100% free, with NO ADs, and NO TRACKING</strong> to get hands-on experience building, hosting, and managing something real on The Web. While traditional encyclopedias strive for accuracy and verifiability, we celebrate creative fabrication, satirical commentary, and the delightfully convincing nonsense that AI can generate.
            </p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Derpedia is a parody website. Like everything AI generated, nothing here should be cited in academic papers, used to settle arguments, or relied upon for actual factual information. For real knowledge, please visit <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>What Makes Derpedia Special?</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike serious reference works, Derpedia embraces the chaotic potential of AI-generated content. Our articles are written entirely by Gemini as you search for new topics. This produces content that looks official but is wonderfully unreliable.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>100% AI-Generated:</strong> Every article on Derpedia is written by AI tools (currently Google's Gemini), creating a fascinating mix of plausible-sounding nonsense.</li>
                <li><strong>Familiar Format:</strong> We use the same format as Wikipedia, making our absurdity all the more convincing.</li>
                <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> The entire project is <a href="https://github.com/davenport651/derpedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on GitHub</a>, because transparency is important, even in parody.</li>
                <li><strong>Educational Platform:</strong> Built on a homelab server in the basement of a 100 year old home so my wife and kids can see the lights dim every time you send us an HTML POST.</li>
                <li><strong>No Ads, No Tracking:</strong> Just pure, unadulterated satirical content served from our basement.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Support Derpedia</h2>
            <p>
                We are doing this for the smiles, not the clicks, but every website (especially one using an AI API) has real costs in electricity, bandwidth, generation, and (most importantly) a Dad's precious time. If you enjoy what we're doing and want to contribute:
